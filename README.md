## How it works
When this extension is enabled, it just add some light text colors and dark background colors to some tags.
When disabled, the extension just remove the css added. 

## Known Issues
If the page contains css code inside style tags, when the extension is disabled, after a previous enabled, the colors might be lost.
In this case it's necessary to refresh the page to recovery all colors correctly.
